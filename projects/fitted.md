## What is Fitted?

Fitted puts power back into the hands of local business owners by building out a Brick and Mortar store's online catalog and providing an online portal to share inventory.

## My involvement

I am a Senior API Engineer at Fitted and I'm lovin' it. I work heavily in Typescript, Node.js, Google Cloud Platform and lots of other fun stuff.
