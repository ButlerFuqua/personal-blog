I'm very passionate about my faith, and this company will be a way I can help further the Gospel and build disciples of Jesus Christ.

## What do I do?

I work one on one with Christian ministries (churches, missionaries, etc.) and build any software that may help their effort. 

This could be a website, a mobile app, or more.
